# UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - UNSTABLE

# BareGo

> **"Simplicity is not less; it is the essence of more."**

**BareGo** is a minimalistic yet powerful starter kit for [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/). It embraces simplicity, providing the bare essentials you need to begin a new project without unnecessary clutter or complexity.

---

## Philosophy

BareGo is built on the principle that less is more. It gives you a clean foundation to construct your ideas with flexibility and clarity. By prioritizing essential configurations and straightforward structure, BareGo encourages craftsmanship in code, letting you add only what you truly need.

---

## Features

- **Clean Directory Structure**  
  Easily find your way around a project with a consistent, minimal layout.

- **Essential Tooling**  
  Includes a bare-bones setup for testing, linting, and formatting—no frills, just the necessities.

- **Opinionated Yet Flexible**  
  Offers a minimal set of conventions, but you have full control to adapt or extend.

- **Fast and Lightweight**  
  No superfluous dependencies or frameworks—just Go.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/barego.git
   cd barego
   ```

2. **Initialize Go Modules**  
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   By default, it may run a simple HTTP server or a CLI example, depending on your chosen structure.

4. **Test Your Setup**  
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```
   This runs the basic test suite to ensure everything works out of the box.

## Project Structure

A minimal example structure might look like this:

```
barego/
├── cmd/
│   └── barego/       # Main application entry point
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   └── pkg/          # Internal packages
│       └── example.go
├── pkg/              # Exported packages (if you want to share code)
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── README.md
```

- **`cmd/`**: Contains the main Go programs (e.g., `barego/main.go`).  
- **`internal/`**: Houses internal packages not meant for public consumption.  
- **`pkg/`**: (Optional) Shared packages meant to be used externally if needed.  
- **`go.mod`/`go.sum`**: Track dependencies.

---

## Customizing BareGo

1. **Add Frameworks or Libraries**: If you need something like an HTTP router, logging library, or database driver, simply add it:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```
   Then update your `main.go` or package code accordingly.

2. **Configurations**: Provide a basic `.env` or config file if needed. BareGo doesn’t enforce any particular config pattern.

3. **Testing & CI**: Integrate with your preferred CI/CD pipeline. BareGo uses the standard `go test` as a base, but you can add more robust testing frameworks or coverage tools as you see fit.

4. **Directory Layout**: Reorganize folders based on your project’s growth. BareGo only gives you a gentle push in a consistent direction.
